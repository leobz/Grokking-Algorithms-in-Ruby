# Grokking Algorithms in Ruby

## Content
The repository includes Ruby implementations of the following algorithms and data structures:

1. Binary Search
2. Sorting (Quick Sort, Selection Sort, etc.)
3. Data Structures (Lists, Stacks, Queues, etc.)
4. Recursive Algorithms
5. Graph Search Algorithms

## Testing
The tests also include benchmarks that will show you the time it takes for each algorithm to run.

```bash
$ ruby test_arrays_sort.rb
